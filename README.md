# EZEE-SHOP

This is my HTML project based on an E-Commerce website listing various types of goods like mobile phones, watches, clothes, shoes, elctronics etc. I have the best quality product at lowest prices. I have implemented our concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript too. It acts as a interface for the viewing users.
